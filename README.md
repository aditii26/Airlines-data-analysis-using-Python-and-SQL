# ✈️ Airlines Data Analysis Using Python and SQL

### **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing airlines data to address various **business challenges** using **Python** and **SQL**. The project is structured into several key components, including:

- **Database Connection & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Establishing a connection to the database.
  - Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL queries to understand the underlying data.

- **Business Problem Definition**  
  - **Identifying** and **defining** the business problem related to the airlines data. This involves understanding the context and formulating the right questions to address through data analysis.

- **Data Analysis Using SQL**  
  - Executing SQL queries to tackle various **research questions** and extract meaningful insights from the data.

- **Analyzing & Visualizing Insights**  
  - Utilizing **Python libraries** to analyze the results from SQL queries and create visual representations of the insights.

- **PDF Report Generation**  
  - Compiling the entire analysis, including data, insights, and visualizations, into a **comprehensive PDF report** for stakeholders.

### **Business Problem**
The project begins with the **identification and definition** of the core business problem related to airlines data. This step is crucial as it sets the foundation for all subsequent analysis and decision-making.

### **Database Connection & EDA Using SQL**
- **Database Connection**: Establish a secure connection to the database.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Utilize SQL queries to explore the data.
  - Identify key trends, patterns, and anomalies in the dataset.

### **Data Analysis Using SQL**
- Execute targeted **SQL queries** to answer specific research questions.
- **Extract meaningful insights** that can help in solving the identified business problems.

### **Analyzing & Visualizing Insights**
- Use **Python** (with libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly) to visualize the insights derived from SQL queries.
- **Graphs and charts** will be used to convey findings clearly and effectively.

### **PDF Report Generation**
- Compile the analysis, insights, and visualizations into a well-structured **PDF report**.
- The report will serve as a valuable resource for stakeholders to understand the analysis and make informed decisions.
